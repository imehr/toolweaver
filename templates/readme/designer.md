## 💡 How Everything Works

### Your Project Space
```
📁 Your Project
├── 📁 data/          <- Put your raw data here (interviews, notes)
├── 📁 exports/       <- Find your finished work here
└── 📁 memory/        <- The system's understanding of your project
```

### The Memory System Explained
Think of the memory system as your project's brain:
- It remembers everything you've done
- It learns patterns from your research
- It helps connect insights across interviews
- It keeps your work organized automatically

## 📝 Common Tasks

### Analyzing Interviews
1. Put your interview files in `data/interviews`
2. Say "Analyze the new interviews"
3. Find insights in `exports/insights`

### Finding Patterns
1. Say "Show me patterns from all interviews"
2. The system will show connections it found
3. Export as PDF by saying "Export insights as PDF"

### Coming Back Later
1. Open Cursor
2. Say "Continue working on ${project_name}"
3. All your work will be right where you left it
