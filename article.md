# ToolWeaver: Building an Intelligent Tool Ecosystem for UX Research Agent

## Introduction

User Experience (UX) research requires handling complex, multi-step processes from raw data collection to final design outputs. ToolWeaver provides a framework for building specialized tools that can be orchestrated by a single AI agent (similar to small language model agents) to conduct comprehensive UX research and design processes. By leveraging Cursor's agent capabilities, ToolWeaver enables the creation and orchestration of purpose-built tools for each step of the UX research workflow.

    style TM fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style M fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

## Tool Recipes: User-Defined Workflows

One of ToolWeaver's most powerful features is its Tool Recipe system, which allows users to define precise, multi-step workflows for complex tasks. Tool Recipes provide a structured way to specify how tools should process information while maintaining tight integration with the memory system.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Recipe Components"
        R[Recipe Definition]
        S[Steps]
        M[Memory Integration]
        V[Validation Rules]
    end
    
    subgraph "Memory System"
        STM[Short-Term Memory]
        WM[Working Memory]
        LTM[Long-Term Memory]
    end
    
    R --> S
    S --> M
    M --> V
    
    M --> STM
    M --> WM
    M --> LTM
    
    style R fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style M fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style V fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

### Recipe Structure Example

Here's how a Tool Recipe is defined for a UX research workflow:

```yaml
name: "ux_interview_analysis"
description: "Analyze and synthesize user interviews for UX research"
version: "1.0.0"

steps:
  - name: "transcript_analysis"
    type: "data_processing"
    description: "Analyze raw interview transcripts"
    memory_operations:
      read: ["raw_transcripts"]
      write: ["cleaned_transcripts"]
      context: ["cleaning_patterns"]
    operations:
      - "remove_filler_words"
      - "correct_grammar"

  - name: "insight_annotation"
    type: "analysis"
    description: "Annotate key insights"
    memory_operations:
      read: ["cleaned_transcripts"]
      write: ["annotated_insights"]
      context: ["annotation_patterns"]
    operations:
      - "highlight_key_quotes"
      - "tag_sentiments"
    user_checkpoint: true
```

### Memory Integration in Recipes

Tool Recipes interact with the memory system at three distinct levels:

1. **Short-Term Memory**
   - Stores immediate step results
   - Maintains current processing context
   - Handles intermediate data between steps

2. **Working Memory**
   - Manages active workflow state
   - Tracks patterns during execution
   - Maintains processing context across steps

3. **Long-Term Memory**
   - Archives completed analyses
   - Stores proven workflow patterns
   - Maintains reusable insights

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Recipe
    participant STM as Short-Term Memory
    participant WM as Working Memory
    participant LTM as Long-Term Memory

    Recipe->>STM: Store Step Results
    STM->>WM: Update Workflow State
    WM->>Recipe: Provide Context
    Recipe->>LTM: Archive Insights
    LTM->>WM: Reuse Patterns
    WM->>STM: Update Context
```

## Project Workspaces and Memory Management

ToolWeaver introduces the concept of Project Workspaces to organize tools, recipes, and memory contexts for different projects. This allows for efficient management of multiple UX research projects while maintaining isolated memory spaces and project-specific configurations.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Project Workspace"
        P[Project Config]
        T[Selected Tools]
        R[Active Recipes]
        M[Project Memory]
    end
    
    subgraph "Global Repository"
        GT[Tool Registry]
        GR[Recipe Registry]
        GM[Global Patterns]
    end
    
    P --> T
    P --> R
    P --> M
    
    GT -.-> T
    GR -.-> R
    GM -.-> M
    
    style P fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style M fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style GM fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
```

### Project Configuration Example

```yaml
name: "ux_research_2024_q1"
description: "Q1 2024 User Research for Product X"
version: "1.0.0"

workspace:
  data_directory: "./research_data/2024_q1/"
  memory_namespace: "project_x_2024_q1"
  export_directory: "./exports/2024_q1/"

tools:
  - name: "interview_analyzer"
    version: "1.2.0"
    config:
      batch_size: 5
      parallel_processing: true
  - name: "insight_synthesizer"
    version: "1.0.1"
  - name: "report_generator"
    version: "2.1.0"

recipes:
  - name: "ux_interview_analysis"
    version: "1.0.0"
    batch_processing:
      enabled: true
      input_pattern: "*.transcript"
      watch_directory: true
      auto_process_new: true

memory:
  namespace: "project_x_2024_q1"
  retention_policy:
    short_term: "30d"
    working: "90d"
    long_term: "unlimited"
  export_formats:
    - format: "pdf"
      template: "executive_summary"
    - format: "json"
      template: "raw_insights"
  unstructured_data:
    enabled: true
    storage_path: "./memory/unstructured/"
```

### Batch Processing with Memory Context

Here's how the enhanced interview analysis recipe handles batch processing while maintaining project context:

```yaml
name: "ux_interview_analysis"
description: "Batch process multiple interview transcripts"
version: "1.0.0"

batch_config:
  input_directory: "${workspace.data_directory}/transcripts/"
  pattern: "*.transcript"
  parallel_processing: true
  max_concurrent: 5

steps:
  - name: "batch_initialization"
    type: "setup"
    description: "Initialize batch processing context"
    memory_operations:
      write: ["batch_context"]
      context: ["project_patterns"]
    operations:
      - "scan_input_directory"
      - "create_batch_registry"
      - "initialize_project_memory"

  - name: "transcript_analysis"
    type: "data_processing"
    description: "Process each transcript"
    batch_mode: true
    memory_operations:
      read: ["batch_context", "project_patterns"]
      write: ["processed_transcripts"]
      context: ["analysis_patterns"]
    operations:
      - "remove_filler_words"
      - "correct_grammar"
      - "update_batch_progress"

  - name: "cross_transcript_analysis"
    type: "analysis"
    description: "Analyze patterns across all transcripts"
    memory_operations:
      read: ["processed_transcripts", "project_patterns"]
      write: ["cross_transcript_insights"]
      context: ["project_insights"]
    operations:
      - "identify_common_themes"
      - "cross_reference_insights"
      - "update_project_patterns"

  - name: "memory_consolidation"
    type: "synthesis"
    description: "Consolidate insights into project memory"
    memory_operations:
      read: ["cross_transcript_insights", "project_insights"]
      write: ["project_memory"]
      context: ["project_patterns"]
    operations:
      - "merge_insights"
      - "update_project_context"
      - "archive_batch_results"
    user_checkpoint: true

export_configs:
  - name: "executive_summary"
    format: "pdf"
    template: "executive_template"
    sections: ["key_findings", "themes", "recommendations"]
  
  - name: "raw_insights"
    format: "json"
    structure: "hierarchical"
    include: ["insights", "patterns", "metadata"]
```

### Memory Namespace Management

The memory system organizes data in hierarchical namespaces:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Memory Hierarchy"
        G[Global Memory]
        P1[Project A Memory]
        P2[Project B Memory]
        B1[Batch 1]
        B2[Batch 2]
    end
    
    G --> P1
    G --> P2
    P1 --> B1
    P1 --> B2
    
    subgraph "Memory Types"
        S[Structured Data]
        U[Unstructured Data]
        M[Mixed Content]
    end
    
    B1 --> S
    B1 --> U
    B2 --> M
    
    style G fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style P1 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style P2 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
```

1. **Project Isolation**
   - Each project has its own memory namespace
   - Cross-project patterns stored in global memory
   - Configurable retention policies per namespace

2. **Memory Types**
   - Structured data (JSON, YAML)
   - Unstructured data (text, audio, images)
   - Mixed content with metadata

3. **Memory Operations**
   - Automatic namespace management
   - Cross-project pattern recognition
   - Configurable export formats
   - Batch processing state management

### Project Workspace Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent
    participant Workspace
    participant Tools
    participant Memory

    User->>Agent: Create Project
    Agent->>Workspace: Initialize Config
    Workspace->>Tools: Select Required Tools
    Tools->>Agent: Missing Tool Alert
    Agent->>Tools: Create & Register Tool
    Tools->>Workspace: Update Tool Registry
    
    User->>Workspace: Add Data Files
    Workspace->>Memory: Initialize Project Memory
    
    loop Batch Processing
        Workspace->>Tools: Process Batch
        Tools->>Memory: Update Project Memory
        Memory->>Workspace: Sync Project State
    end
    
    User->>Memory: Export Insights
    Memory->>User: Generated Reports
```

## How It Works

1. **Single Agent, Multiple Tools, Customizable Recipes**
   - One Cursor agent orchestrates the entire process
   - Each tool is specialized for a specific task
   - Tool Recipes define precise workflows
   - Agent maintains context and manages execution

2. **Tool and Recipe Selection**
   - Agent analyzes task requirements
   - Selects appropriate tools and recipes
   - Executes workflow with proper parameters
   - Processes and stores results in memory

3. **Workflow Management**
   - Recipe defines step sequence and checkpoints
   - Agent maintains research context
   - Memory system ensures data consistency
   - User can intervene at defined checkpoints

## Example Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> InitialSetup
    InitialSetup --> DataCollection: Select Interview Tool
    DataCollection --> Analysis: Select Analysis Tool
    Analysis --> Synthesis: Select Insight Tool
    Synthesis --> Design: Select Design Tool
    Design --> Validation: Select Testing Tool
    Validation --> [*]: Complete or Iterate
    
    state DataCollection {

### Project Context Management

The system maintains context across sessions:

1. **Context Persistence**
   - Saves project state on switching
   - Restores context when returning
   - Maintains recent actions history

2. **User Context**
   - Automatically detects user type
   - Adapts interaction style
   - Provides relevant examples

3. **Workflow Guidance**
   - Shows next steps
   - Suggests relevant commands
   - Provides contextual help

## Real-World Usage: A Tale of Two Projects

Let's follow two UX researchers, Alice and Bob, as they use ToolWeaver for different projects. This example demonstrates how the system adapts to different needs and automatically creates tools when required.

### Project Initialization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Agent
    participant Tools
    participant Memory

    Alice->>Agent: "I need to analyze user interviews for mobile app redesign"
    Agent->>Tools: Check Available Tools
    Agent->>Memory: Create Project Space
    Agent->>Alice: Show Getting Started Guide

    Note over Alice,Memory: Project 1 Created

    Alice->>Agent: "Add my interview transcripts to the project"
    Agent->>Memory: Store Transcripts
    Agent->>Tools: Begin Analysis
```

Alice starts her mobile app redesign project:

```
Alice: "I need to analyze user interviews for mobile app redesign"
Agent: "I'll create a new project for your mobile app research. I'll set up:
       - Interview analysis tools
       - Project workspace
       - Memory namespace
       Would you like to start with the interview analysis?"

Alice: "Yes, I have 20 interview transcripts to analyze"
Agent: "I'll set up batch processing for your interviews. 
       Please put the transcripts in the data/interviews folder.
       I'll analyze them automatically and generate insights."
```

Meanwhile, Bob starts his enterprise dashboard project:

```
Bob: "Create a project for enterprise dashboard user research"
Agent: "Creating project 'enterprise_dashboard_research'.
       I'll set up the same interview analysis toolkit.
       Where would you like to store your project files?"

Bob: "Use the default location"
Agent: "Project created. You can start by adding your interview transcripts."
```

### Diverging Project Needs

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Bob
    participant Agent
    participant Tools
    participant Memory

    Bob->>Agent: "I need to analyze competitor dashboards"
    Agent->>Tools: Check for Tool
    Tools->>Agent: Tool Not Found
    Agent->>Tools: Create Competitor Analysis Tool
    Agent->>Bob: Tool Created & Added
    
    Note over Bob,Memory: Project Evolution

    Bob->>Agent: "Compare our design with competitors"
    Agent->>Tools: Run Comparison
    Tools->>Memory: Store Analysis
    Agent->>Bob: Show Results
```

As the projects progress, different needs emerge:

```
Bob: "I need to analyze competitor dashboards too"
Agent: "I notice we don't have a competitor analysis tool yet.
       I'll create one that can:
       - Analyze dashboard screenshots
       - Compare feature sets
       - Track UX patterns
       Creating tool now..."

[Agent creates new tool]

Agent: "I've created and added the competitor_analysis tool to your project.
       You can now use commands like:
       - 'Analyze competitor dashboard <screenshot>'
       - 'Compare our features with competitors'
       - 'Show competitive analysis report'"
```

### Project Configurations Diverge

```yaml
# mobile_app/project.yaml
tools:
  - name: "interview_analyzer"
    config:
      focus: "mobile_interactions"
  - name: "insight_synthesizer"
    config:
      patterns: ["gesture_patterns", "mobile_flows"]

# enterprise_dashboard/project.yaml
tools:
  - name: "interview_analyzer"
    config:
      focus: "dashboard_usability"
  - name: "insight_synthesizer"
    config:
      patterns: ["data_visualization", "workflow_patterns"]
  - name: "competitor_analysis"    # Additional tool
    config:
      focus: "enterprise_dashboards"
      features: ["layout_analysis", "feature_comparison"]
```

### Cross-Project Learning

Later, Alice discovers Bob's competitor analysis approach:

```
Alice: "Show me what tools are available in other projects"
Agent: "I see a competitor_analysis tool in the enterprise_dashboard project.
       Would you like me to adapt it for mobile app analysis?"

Alice: "Yes, adapt it for mobile app competitors"
Agent: "I'll modify the tool for mobile app analysis:
       - Updating feature comparison for mobile apps
       - Adding gesture pattern analysis
       - Modifying layout analysis for mobile screens"
```

### Memory System Adaptation

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Mobile App Project"
        MA[Memory Space]
        MI[Interview Insights]
        MG[Gesture Patterns]
    end
    
    subgraph "Dashboard Project"
        DA[Memory Space]
        DI[Interview Insights]
        DC[Competitor Analysis]
    end
    
    subgraph "Global Patterns"
        GP[Shared UX Patterns]
        GI[Interview Methods]
    end
    
    MA --> MI
    MA --> MG
    DA --> DI
    DA --> DC
    
    MI --> GP
    DI --> GP
    DC --> GP
```

The memory system maintains project isolation while enabling pattern sharing:

```
Bob: "What patterns can we share with other projects?"
Agent: "I've identified these shareable patterns:
       - User interview techniques
       - Navigation preferences
       - Information hierarchy
       Would you like me to share these with the mobile app project?"
```

### Project Evolution

As projects evolve, they develop distinct tool sets:

Mobile App Project:
```python
# Original tools
- interview_analyzer (mobile focus)
- insight_synthesizer
- journey_mapper

# Added later
- competitor_analysis (mobile-adapted)
- gesture_pattern_analyzer
```

Dashboard Project:
```python
# Original tools
- interview_analyzer (dashboard focus)
- insight_synthesizer
- competitor_analysis (original)

# Added later
- dashboard_heuristic_evaluator
- data_visualization_analyzer
```

This real-world example demonstrates how:
1. Projects can start with similar tools but evolve differently
2. The agent creates new tools based on emerging needs
3. Tools can be shared and adapted between projects
4. Memory systems maintain project isolation while enabling pattern sharing
